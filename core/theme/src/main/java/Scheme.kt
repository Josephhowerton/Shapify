/**
 * A color scheme holds all the named color parameters for a [MaterialTheme].
 *
 * Color schemes are designed to be harmonious, ensure accessible text, and distinguish UI
 * elements and surfaces from one another. There are two built-in baseline schemes,
 * [lightColorScheme] and a [darkColorScheme], that can be used as-is or customized.
 *
 * The Material color system and custom schemes provide default values for color as a starting point
 * for customization.
 *
 * To learn more about colors, see [Material Design colors](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/overview).
 *
 * @property primary The primary color is the color displayed most frequently across your appâ€™s
 * screens and components.
 * @property onPrimary Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the primary color.
 * @property primaryContainer The preferred tonal color of containers.
 * @property onPrimaryContainer The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on
 * top of [primaryContainer].
 * @property inversePrimary Color to be used as a "primary" color in places where the inverse color
 * scheme is needed, such as the button on a SnackBar.
 * @property secondary The secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your
 * product. Secondary colors are best for:
 * - Floating action buttons
 * - Selection controls, like checkboxes and radio buttons
 * - Highlighting selected text
 * - Links and headlines
 * @property onSecondary Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the secondary color.
 * @property secondaryContainer A tonal color to be used in containers.
 * @property onSecondaryContainer The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on
 * top of [secondaryContainer].
 * @property tertiary The tertiary color that can be used to balance primary and secondary
 * colors, or bring heightened attention to an element such as an input field.
 * @property onTertiary Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the tertiary color.
 * @property tertiaryContainer A tonal color to be used in containers.
 * @property onTertiaryContainer The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on
 * top of [tertiaryContainer].
 * @property background The background color that appears behind scrollable content.
 * @property onBackground Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the background color.
 * @property surface The surface color that affect surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets,
 * and menus.
 * @property onSurface Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the surface color.
 * @property surfaceVariant Another option for a color with similar uses of [surface].
 * @property onSurfaceVariant The color (and state variants) that can be used for content on top of
 * [surface].
 * @property surfaceTint This color will be used by components that apply tonal elevation and is
 * applied on top of [surface]. The higher the elevation the more this color is used.
 * @property inverseSurface A color that contrasts sharply with [surface]. Useful for surfaces that
 * sit on top of other surfaces with [surface] color.
 * @property inverseOnSurface A color that contrasts well with [inverseSurface]. Useful for content
 * that sits on top of containers that are [inverseSurface].
 * @property error The error color is used to indicate errors in components, such as invalid text in
 * a text field.
 * @property onError Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the error color.
 * @property errorContainer The preferred tonal color of error containers.
 * @property onErrorContainer The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on
 * top of [errorContainer].
 * @property outline Subtle color used for boundaries. Outline color role adds contrast for
 * accessibility purposes.
 * @property outlineVariant Utility color used for boundaries for decorative elements when strong
 * contrast is not required.
 * @property scrim Color of a scrim that obscures content.
